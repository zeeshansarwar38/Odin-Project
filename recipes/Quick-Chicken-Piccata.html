    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
        <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
    </ol>
